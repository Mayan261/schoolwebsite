						<p>At Good News Lutheran College we appreciate and care about all our students individually. You will see some of them on this website or on our Facebook page but seeing them truly absorbed in their learning and engaging with each other will show you so much more.

							We are very blessed to have beautiful grounds and state-of-the-art facilities surrounding us, however it is our nurturing approach to how we mentor and guide our students that is our most valuable asset.

							Good News offers a range of different opportunities in a supportive environment that encourages exploration and fosters enthusiasm. Our ambition is for each student to find their passion and their purpose by taking hold of opportunities and uncovering what allows them to thrive.

							We aim for every day to be engaging and enriching and encourage academic curiosity; prepare our students to be ready for the rapidly changing future though a focus on critical thinking, creativity, ethics and collaboration.

							We support and encourage our students to pursue their dreams, whether they involve tertiary study, a pre-vocational course, direct entry into the work force, performing arts, elite sport or anything else they may imagine for themselves. The College is proud of all our students and recognise their individual achievements as they graduate with honour, courage and integrity.

							We are proud of our College and the direction we are taking into contemporary learning in the agile learning spaces we have created. The International Baccalaureate philosophy and curriculum framework not only provides our students with a highly regarded academic program, but through a focus on international mindedness encourages us to recognise and respect the many cultures that make up our diverse community.

							The responsibility entrusted to us by our parents is taken very seriously and we appreciate the great honour we are given to impact the lives of each student.</p>

					<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">History of GNLC</h5>
					<p>The concept for Good News Lutheran College began in 1992 as a result of the vision of members of the Lutheran congregations of Christ the Lord - Laverton and St. Philip's - Werribee.
						Australia has had Lutheran schools ever since the first Lutheran settlers arrived in South Australia from Germany in 1839. Even before the SA government became formally involved in education, Lutheran communities established their own schools because they were concerned about the future of their children. They wanted to provide for the growth of their children spiritually, intellectually, socially and physically.

						The Lutheran school system has since grown to be one of the largest networks of independent schools in Australia, currently educating over 42,000 students in 86 Lutheran schools and 57 Early Childhood Centres throughout Australia. Located in Wyndham, and continuing a 175-year tradition of Lutheran education in Australia, Good News Lutheran College is one of 16 Lutheran schools in Victoria.

						The College has grown significantly from a small group of 24 students who commenced in 1997, opening as a primary school and remaining so until 2010. After several years of planning, the College began its growth into secondary schooling in 2011, when the first classes of Year 7 began. These students then became our first Year 12s graduating at the end of 2016.

						Meanwhile, in 2012, the purchase of the adjacent farm land was finalised in order to accommodate the planned growth. The original farm house still remains, though several new facilities for Science and Technologies, as well as modern and flexible learning spaces for Middle and Senior students have recently been built. Now with over 1000 students across Prep â€“ Year 12, the College continues to strengthen its educational and pastoral programmes with the International Baccalaureate PYP and MYP programmes currently going through implementation.</p>
